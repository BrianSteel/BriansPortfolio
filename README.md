<h1 align="center">HEY THERE!! I AM BRIAN.</h1>

This is my portfolio.

Few things to watch out for: 

- Not many useful buttons. I will update it later.
- Fully responsive ðŸ˜€
- form validation added ðŸ˜€
- not backed by database
- awesome dark theme (check it out) ðŸ˜€

### Notice
If you have the Grammarly extension on your chrome then this creates a problem with the website. It increases the height of the HTML when you press on the textarea. Watch out for that.
Quick Fix for now: Turn off Grammarly extention for this site.
